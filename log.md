# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Dug up and dusted off the timetable tracker bot project, its #BackTo~~School~~Uni in a week anyway. Decided to not use an API library, but to write the interface myself, started figuring it out. 

**Thoughts:** Turns out API requests are a lot simpler than I thought, I think I would have been figuring out the library longer than writing it myself. Also, I'm back to coding! I had forgotten how good it feels to solve problems and see your actually code working (after at least an hour of debugging, of course).

### Day 2: August 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Schedule for the next semester just dropped (weird, so early?): wrote that in, tweaking the database along the way. Wrote the logic of API polling, will probably finish it tomorrow. Wanted to start on scheduling, but was tired.

**Thoughts**: Woke up and got straight back to coding — sleep is just an obstacle i guess lol. Spent basically the whole day at it, going slow but going. Wanted to continue but was really tired, the brain was refusing to do the braining. Probably shouldn't overdo it — risk burning out having barely started.
